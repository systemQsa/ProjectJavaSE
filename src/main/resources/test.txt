Multithreading can be a great way to increase the performance of some types of programs.
However, mulithreading is even more challenging than multitasking.
The threads are executing within the same program and are hence reading and writing the same memory simultaneously.
This can result in errors not seen in a singlethreaded program.
Some of these errors may not be seen on single CPU machines, because two threads never really execute "simultaneously".
Modern computers, though, come with multi core CPUs, and even with multiple CPUs too.
This means that separate threads can be executed by separate cores or CPUs simultaneously.
